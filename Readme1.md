## Git :
 Versatile version contol system for tracking changes in code and collaborating with others.
 Due to a distributed version control system, Git enables you to revert to the previous state or review the projectâ€™s history.
 Git is an open-source command-line-based version-control system for software development. While Git is a command-line tool and you also need to host and maintain a server on which you can use Git for versioning.
 ## GitHub:
Popular web-hosted services for Git repositories.
GitHub is a repository hosting service that uses Git. GitHub provides a web-based hosting service with a graphical user interface(GUI) and git command line interface (CLI). It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as wikis and basic task management tools, for every project. GitHub provides cloud storage for source code, supports all popular programming languages, and streamlines the iteration process. GitHub includes a free plan for individual developers and for hosting open-source projects.

Version control: A system that allows you to keep track of changes to your documents. This process allows you to recover older versions of the documents if any mistakes are made.


## Branches with GitHub
Abranch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make change.
<br>
In the child branch, you can build, make edits, testthe changes, and then merge them with the main branch.
<br>
To ensure that changes are made by one member, do not impede or affect the workflow of other members,
multiple branches can be created and merged with the main branch.
<br>
A pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits mede to the main branch.
